Matlab and C code for handling Image based tasks.

-- **Stanford-40:** This folder contains C code for training models to classify actions in images. Training was performed using [Latent Structural SVM](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cnyu/latentssvm/) . The original C-code is modified to serve the task of classifying actions in images. This work is presented in the following paper:

Abidi, Shaukat, Massimo Piccardi, and Mary-Anne Williams. "Static action recognition by efficient greedy inference." _2016 IEEE Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)_. IEEE, 2016.

-- All other folders contain Matlab and C code for different tasks. All of this work was conducted when Deeplearning was taking over the field of Computer Vision for Classification (CNNs). During those days, a large amount of development time was taken by writing code for feature generation and its engineering.
